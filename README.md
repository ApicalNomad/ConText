# ConText
Memorable final group project for CMSC 495, a document search/highlighter, finished 12/2021


Brainchild of Michelle March - primary coder along with John Ingle, code assistant/reviser was myself Yousaf Chaudry, program QA tester was Patrick McCully. 

The concept was simple enough, to help people find specific text within a document by highlighting all of its occurrences. It became more complex as we had to manage certain conditions as in, at what depth (sentence vs paragraph) and counting occurrences as pure string or if substring was acceptable.
